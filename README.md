## 🌀 What is this?
This is **ERIS AI** — a sleek, fully functional chat interface… made completely useless for the hackathon theme.  
It *looks great*, it *works great*, and it solves absolutely **nothing**.

---

## 🎯 Why Useless?
Because the theme *demanded* it!  
The challenge was to build the most impractical, financially unviable software that doesn’t pretend to be useful.  
So here we are: a polished interface that nobody needed, yet everybody will admire.

---

## 🚀 How to Run (pointlessly)
1. Clone this repo:

   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/useless-hackathon-repo.git
   cd useless-hackathon-repo
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.  
3. Bask in its sheer purposeless beauty.
